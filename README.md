# 2x2 Rubik's Cube Visualizer and Solver

A simple 2x2 Rubik's Cube visualization built using `pygame`. This project allows users to interact with a virtual Rubik's Cube, manipulate its sides, shuffle it, and even trigger an automated solve function.

## Features

- **3D Cube Rotation**: Rotate the cube using the mouse to view it from different angles.
- **Side Manipulation**: Use keyboard keys to turn the cube's sides.
- **Shuffle Function**: Randomly shuffles the cube for a new challenge.
- **Solve Function**: Automatically solves the cube to its original state.

## Installation
